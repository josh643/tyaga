# State of AI Report (2025/2026 Summary)

## Executive Summary
The AI landscape has matured from "experimentation" to "deployment". Compute costs are stabilizing, but data quality is the new bottleneck.

### Key Trends
1. **Small Language Models (SLMs)**: Running high-quality models on edge devices (laptops, phones) is now standard.
2. **Agentic Workflows**: The focus has moved from "Chatbots" to "Agents" that can execute multi-step tasks (browsing, coding, emailing).
3. **Regulation**: The EU AI Act is fully enforceable; US compliance requires transparency in training data.

### Predictions
- **Vertical AI**: General models are being outperformed by fine-tuned vertical models (e.g., AI specifically for Law, Bio, or Music).
- **Video Generation**: Text-to-Video is now commercially viable for marketing (replacing stock footage).

# Practical Founders (Bootstrapping Guide)

## The Philosophy
"Profit is the best funding." Practical Founders focuses on building sustainable, revenue-first businesses without VC pressure.

### Core Principles
1. **Sell Before You Build**: Validate demand by getting pre-orders or consulting contracts.
2. **Niche Down**: Don't boil the ocean. Solve a $1M problem for a specific group, not a $1B problem for everyone.
3. **Service-to-Product**: Start as a consultancy (high cash flow), then automate your service into software.

### Metrics that Matter
- **Cash Flow**: Burn rate is the enemy.
- **Gross Margin**: Ensure your unit economics work from Day 1.
- **Customer Intimacy**: Talk to every customer personally.

Define the company/business in a single declarative sentence.

## 2. Problem
Describe the pain of the customer (or the customer's customer). How is this addressed today and what are the shortcomings to current solutions?

## 3. Solution
Explain your eureka moment. Why is your value prop unique and compelling? Why does it endure? And where does it go from here?

## 4. Why Now?
The best companies almost always have a clear why now? Nature hates a vacuum—so why hasn't your solution been built before?

  ycSafe: `
# Y Combinator SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity)

*Note: This is a summary of the standard terms. Always consult a lawyer.*

## The Concept
A SAFE is not debt. It is not equity. It is a warrant to purchase stock in a future priced round.

## Key Variables to Define
1. **Valuation Cap**: The most important number. E.g., $5M. If the company raises later at $10M, the SAFE holders convert as if the valuation was $5M (getting more shares for their money).
2. **Discount**: Usually 20%. If there is no cap (or the cap isn't hit), investors get a 20% discount on the share price of the next round.

## MFN (Most Favored Nation)
This clause says "If we give better terms to a future investor (e.g., a lower cap), you get those terms too."

## Post-Money vs Pre-Money
YC SAFEs are now "Post-Money" by default. This means the ownership dilution is calculated *after* the SAFE money is accounted for, which provides more certainty to founders about how much of the company they are selling.
